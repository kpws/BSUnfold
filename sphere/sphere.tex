{CR39 detector response for spheres borrowed from Politecnico di Milano. Solid line is data from Michele Ferrarini obtained using MCNPX. Dashed lines were obtained using FLUKA. Scoring was done on 20x20 mm plate in the middle of the spheres. Thickness 2 mm for FLUKA case. Errorbars are $\pm\sigma$. The POLYETHY-material was used in FLUKA.}\label{1}

{Ratio of reaction rate at beam energy 0.1 MeV and 0.3 GeV for FlUKA simulation of Bonner spheres. Done with COMPOUND polyethylene material, using LOW-MAT and $\mathrm{CH}_2$-bound hydrogen and varying density $\rho$. Intersections with Michele Ferrarini's MCNPX simulation results found by solving third order spline through FLUKA data points. Errorbars are $\pm\sigma$. }\label{rho}
